# Visualization-of-Sorting-Algorithms-using-OpenGL-Minor-Project-1
This is my minor project where I had implemented different sorting algorithms using C++ and visualize them using OpenGL.
I implemented 4 sorting algotrithms in this project.
1. Bubble Sort.
2. Insertion Sort.
3. Selection Sort.
4. Ripple Sort.
